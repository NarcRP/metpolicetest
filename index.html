        <br>
        <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> know this definition like a poem there is no way around it. You many read people their rights after they have been arrested <strong>OR</strong> before questioning them. Any information that they have verblly said to you is void if you haven't read them there rights. When making an arrest first of all you would state the reason for them been placed under arrest <i>"You are currently under arrest for Failure to stop for poluce under section 28 of the Road Traffic act 1988"</i> once the reason for the arrest is stated then you would read the following caution as follows.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything you do say can be given as evidence, do you understand these rights that have been read to you</i></p>

    <!-- Section 5 - Persuits -->
    <h3>Section 5 - Persuits:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>If you become involved in a pursuit then your main priority is always the safety of others, this means that driving on opposite lanes of travel and driving on pavements is not permitted as you are putting the public life at risk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are Primary in a pursuit then your job is to relay communications to other officers attempting to join the pursuit or keep up with the pursuit.  If a second unit arrives on a pursuit you may ask them to take over communications whilst you focus on keeping up with the suspect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If a member of traffic enters the pursuit then you must give up primary when requested.</p>
    <br>
    <p>No matter what you must not overtake your fellow officers during a pursuit without clearly announcing yourself over the radio first, when doing this you would say e.g “i am going to be overtaking on your (either left or right) when it is next safe to do so”.  This should only be done when on a straight road and does not endanger the public.</p>

      <h3>Section 7 - Etiqutte</h3>
      <br>
      <p>When communicating over the radio the golden rule is <strong>to give As much information as possible in a short period of time,</strong> to do this we recommend you follow the 3 W’s, <strong>What</strong> is happening, <strong>where</strong> it is happening and <strong>who</strong> is involved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Under no circumstances should you engage in general conversation over the radio, if you wish to have a conversation with someone this must be done in person.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Never talk over each other when on the radio, this ensures proper communication and fluidity of information.</li>
    <li>Ensure that priorities such as pursuits and robberies take priority in radio, meaning that active priorities override small occurrences such as TS(traffic stops).</li>

    <h3>Section 8 - Consensual encounters</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This is the most common encounter that a law enforcement officer will encounter whilst on active duty. in which police use no commands, force,blue lights or sirens, but simply approach a person and engage him in conversation and make plain-view observations without any official restraints, and for which no level of justification is needed. This person would be free to leave at any given time.</p>

    <h3>Section 9 - Reasonable Suspision</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Reasonable Suspicion is a presumption that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed? It is a reas
        onable belief based on facts or circumstances and is informed by a police officer’s training and experience. Reasonable suspicion is seen as more than a guess or hunch but less than probable cause. Often defined as less than probable cause. probable cause reason based upon known facts to believe a crime has been committed or that certain property relates to a crime.</p>

    <p>As an RTP officer, you will specialise in all forms of pursuits, roadblocks, and tactical manoeuvres.</p><br><p>A pursuit is a day-to-day encounter all officers will find, as an RTP unit, your responsibility is to take action in pursuits; RTP officers have authority to take a primary position in a pursuit as well as to take over Communications, this is unless an Interceptor Unit is available or if it is an armed call. As a PCSO and Response officer, you should have encountered a few pursuits and be familiar with what they are and how they work.</p><br><p>Tactical Maneuvers are used by RTP trained officers when a pursuit is deemed dangerous for the public and needs to be stopped (usually when the pursuit goes for more than 7 minutes). Different Tactical Maneuvers RTP officers use and also what you would learn to do in the training is a pit, and a hard stop / TPAC.</p><br>A pit is where an officer would nudge a fleeing vehicle by hitting the rear wheel of a moving vehicle. Pits can only be performed below 100MPH (miles per hour) and they are performed with intent to spin out a fleeing suspect's vehicle.<br>
    <img  class="policetrainingimage" src="img/policetraning2.png">
    <br>
    <img class="policetrainingimage" src="img/policetraning3.png" >
    <p>A Hard Stop is a maneuver which RTP and SCO-19 officers would perform with intent to slow down and stop a moving vehicle safely without disturbing the civilians as much as you would continuing a high speed pursuit. This is performed by several officers surrounding each side of the vehicle and gradually lowering their speed to slow down the vehicle. A TPAC is a maneuver which involves 2 or more officers to box in a stationary or slow-moving vehicle, this is performed by one officer taking front and back of the vehicle to box it in and stop it from fleeing; more officers can lead to it being more successful. Roadblocks are a Traffic officers specialty; a roadblock is where you would create a diversion or road closure using a series of cones and barriers. Roadblocks are mainly used when an RTC (Road Traffic Collision) occurs; this is a way to protect the RTC from incoming traffic and to make the RTC site more safer while diverting traffic instead of closing the entire road off. In your training, you will have to create a few roadblocks, some diagrams of roadblocks we use can be found below. </p>
    <h3><u>View Diagrams under for Roadblock images</u></h3>
    <img src="img/policetraning4.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/policetraning5.png" alt="">
    <h3><u>How the training works</u></h3>
    <p>The RTP course contains several sections which are brought up during training which you will need to learn and perform. This includes a Driving Test, Tactical Maneuver Test, Pursuit Test, Roadblock Test, and  
        a Communications Test. A few Tactical Maneuvers were explained above and are accompanied with diagrams of how they should look when executed; this is also the same for Roadblocks. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Driving Test is a way which the trainer would assess your driving in the worst road conditions, the trainer should give you a speed to not go over during the Test and a few guidelines / conditions that will need to be followed if you aim to score high marks during your RTP training. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Communication is a vital part of the training which you will need to revise and learn; all officers rely on good communications. In the training, the trainer will explain how the communications should be relayed and what to mention during communicating. The main parts of comms we look for during the training is: Locations (Road Names, Postal Codes), Direction (North,East,South,West), DRA Level (Danger Risk Assessment), and the Description of the suspect or vehicle (Person: Racial Code, Clothing) (Car: Colour, License Plate, Make and Model, Doors).
        </p>
    <h3><u>Road Traffic Act Laws and Sections</u></h3>
    <p>In the training, you will need to know and understand at least 8 common known sections which relate to Roads and Transport Policing. Below this you will find 8 common sections which you will need to learn and revise before attempting the Traffic Test.</p>
    <li>Section 1 - Death By Dangerous Driving</li>
    <li>Section 2 - Dangerous Driving</li>
    <li>Section 4 - Driving Under The Influence</li>
    <li>Section 28 - Dangerous Cycling</li>
    <li>Section 89 - Exceeding Any Legal Speed Limit</li>
    <li>Section 163 Sub Section 1 - Failure to Stop for Police</li>
    <li>Section 164 - Gives power to acquire a Driving License or ID on a Traffic Stop</li>
    <li>Section 165 = Authority to Sieze a Vehicle</li>

    <p><strong><i>This is a rough idea of what to expect during the RTP Training and also what you will need to know or learn. From the Heads of the RTP Division, we wish you good luck during your training and hope to see you in RTP soon!</i></strong></p>

      <h3>Section 6 - SFO Duties</h3>
      <p><i>As a specialist Firearms Officer, you will need to be up to date on all tactics for response. To ensure that you master them as much as you can to avoid insolvencies when rapid-responding to a incident, Here you can ready about how to respond to any call with safety of civilians in mind.</i></p>
      <p><u>Bank Robberies</u></p>
      <p>Bank robberies are a serious crime. You as a Specialist Firearms Officer in the MO19 need to understand how to deal with bank robberies in the most safe and efficient way possible, when responding to bank robberies, always make sure that you are there as fast as possible, to gain access to the front entrance and potential back doors. You will have to get in contact with the individuals inside to clarify whether there is a hostage or not. If there is a hostage, you’ll need to negotiate for the hostages’ safe releases. Make sure you always value the hostage’s life and your team’s lives. When the hostage has been successfully retrieved safely, SFO’s will clear the bank to see if there is any planted onto him/her. After the area is clear and the hostage is clean, you may join in with the pursuit. If police have PCSO’s on duty they might want to practice their negotiations, so they are free to do that if the FTO Recommends it!</p>
      <p><u>Buddy System</u></p>
      <p>When in a combat situation like clearing hotel filled with hostile targets, clearing with a buddy is a good idea, if you take fire from a hostile you are more likely to control the scene when there are two of you instead of one, When moving in the buddy system the lead should be in the crouching position and the rear person standing in order to not shoot each other and give the most range of fire.</p>
      <p><u>Situational Awareness</u></p>
      <p>This is basically looking around whilst in combat on a patrol, Make sure that you keep your eyes peeled and keep your head on a swivel to give yourself and your team and much situational awareness as possible.</p>
      <p><u>Breaching a building</u></p>
      <img class="policetrainingimage" src="/metpolicetest/img/breachingaroom.png" alt="">
      <p>Breaching is a key part of the duty of and SFO, however if don’t wrong it could and will have fatal outcomes.
        If there is a single door Breach, you line up on the side that the door handle is not on and the breacher will stand On the other hand side, breacher will shoot the hinges off then, open the door and everyone will move in, two people will check the right, The Breacher will move in. If it a double door. Breacher stands in the middle, shoots the door handles of and then other units will say on each side of the door going in the sides they are standing.</p>
        <p><u>Hostage Negotiations</u></p>
        <p>Specialist Firearms officer will start negations, if a PCSO is on their FTO may ask them to practice negotiations!</p>
        <li>Approach the hostage taker or the location where the hostage is being held</li>
        <li>Tell them that you are Armed Police and here to negotiate</li>
        <li>Ask how many of them there are</li>
        <li>Ask for proof of life, see if the hostage is alive and ok</li>
        <li>Ask if they are armed with knives, firearms etc</li>
        <li>Ask them for their demands (normally free passage & no spike strips) if they ask for free passage try to hid the armed officer and strike when they attempt to leave, but you have to make sure they are far enough away from the hostage to nor risk harming them. ERPT will take primary in the pursuit if fleeing.</li>
        <li>Take the hostages away and search them for potential planted items</li>
        <li>Search the perimeter to make sure there is no one hiding</li>
        <li>Get the hostages to safety</li>
        <p><u>Property raids & entries</u></p>
        <p>When raiding a property, you must flow these basic steps</p>
        <li>Try and knock on the door to see if they come out, if they come out; tell them that they will be detained until property/suspects have been searched.</li>
        <li>If they don’t come out get units at the front of the property and the back to surround the property</li>
        <li>Then breach the door going in together to make sure you cover every last bit.</li>
        <li>When breaching, shout “ARMED POLICE”</li>
        <li>Make sure to search every room one by one in Teams and never separately</li>
        <p><u>Flanking</u></p>
        <p>Flanking is a tactic that can be adopted to almost all attacking situations and most defensive situations, this tactic is a very diverse tactic, but can also be a very difficult to pull off successfully. The successful flanker will take a route which is completely invisible from enemy positions, but also utilizes the shortest route to the desired location, The unsuccessful flanker will take the quickest-possible route, focusing on a single target and ignoring their surroundings, hence entering state of tunnel-vision. Flanking often is used when frontal force cannot diffuse a situation, where instead a “Flank” must be used to get a unit parallel with enemy hostiles to strike from a different angle, often behind the enemy to their left and right sides. Otherwise known as their Flanks.</p>
        <p>To count a flank one must stay alert at all times when in a gunfight, this mean keeping in your toes and moving position constantly, checking not only in front, but all around you in a 360 degree axis to ensure you and your teammates that you are safe to continue in the situation and proceed with a fontal attack. Another method to counter a flank is to flank the flanker, this involves you spotting the flanker before he / she stops you, and adjusting your position to be in a suitable position to diffuse the enemy and secure your allies.</p>
        <p><u>Ambushing</u></p>
        <p>Ambushing is a tactic often adopted by multiple units at a time, usually to stop fleeing individuals after establishing a roadblock further up the road from the pursuing unit to stop the target without the pursuing unit having to stop. This tactic can be adopted in a multitude of effective matters, be it in a major town where a lot of buildings can be utilised as cover for a tactical advantage, or be it in the countryside where hills and embankments can be used as over or even on the main highway using bends in the highway to cover the roadblock and associated units this tactic is a very simple yet effective tactic when it comes to stopping various hostile vehicles and even infantry if a concentrated ambush is set up within a checkpoint as well as being un a suitable location.</p>
        <p><u>Trainings</u></p>
        <p>In MO19 you many attends training regularly, These types of training will be hard training where you will be tested as a team overall just as much as individuals as both SFO’s and Police Officers to make sure your skills aretop notch at all times, These training may include realistic bank robberies, store robberies hostage situation and more</p>
