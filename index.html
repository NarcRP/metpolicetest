        <h3>Section 3 - Basic Cautions:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> know this definition like a poem there is no way around it. You many read people their rights after they have been arrested <strong>OR</strong> before questioning them. Any information that they have verblly said to you is void if you haven't read them there rights. When making an arrest first of all you would state the reason for them been placed under arrest <i>"You are currently under arrest for Failure to stop for poluce under section 28 of the Road Traffic act 1988"</i> once the reason for the arrest is stated then you would read the following caution as follows.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything you do say can be given as evidence, do you understand these rights that have been read to you</i></p>

    <!-- Section 5 - Persuits -->
    <h3>Section 5 - Persuits:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>If you become involved in a pursuit then your main priority is always the safety of others, this means that driving on opposite lanes of travel and driving on pavements is not permitted as you are putting the public life at risk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are Primary in a pursuit then your job is to relay communications to other officers attempting to join the pursuit or keep up with the pursuit.  If a second unit arrives on a pursuit you may ask them to take over communications whilst you focus on keeping up with the suspect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If a member of traffic enters the pursuit then you must give up primary when requested.</p>
    <br>
    <p>No matter what you must not overtake your fellow officers during a pursuit without clearly announcing yourself over the radio first, when doing this you would say e.g “i am going to be overtaking on your (either left or right) when it is next safe to do so”.  This should only be done when on a straight road and does not endanger the public.</p>

      <h3>Section 7 - Etiqutte</h3>
      <br>
      <p>When communicating over the radio the golden rule is <strong>to give As much information as possible in a short period of time,</strong> to do this we recommend you follow the 3 W’s, <strong>What</strong> is happening, <strong>where</strong> it is happening and <strong>who</strong> is involved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Under no circumstances should you engage in general conversation over the radio, if you wish to have a conversation with someone this must be done in person.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Never talk over each other when on the radio, this ensures proper communication and fluidity of information.</li>
    <li>Ensure that priorities such as pursuits and robberies take priority in radio, meaning that active priorities override small occurrences such as TS(traffic stops).</li>

    <h3>Section 8 - Consensual encounters</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This is the most common encounter that a law enforcement officer will encounter whilst on active duty. in which police use no commands, force,blue lights or sirens, but simply approach a person and engage him in conversation and make plain-view observations without any official restraints, and for which no level of justification is needed. This person would be free to leave at any given time.</p>

    <h3>Section 9 - Reasonable Suspision</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Reasonable Suspicion is a presumption that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed? It is a reas
        onable belief based on facts or circumstances and is informed by a police officer’s training and experience. Reasonable suspicion is seen as more than a guess or hunch but less than probable cause. Often defined as less than probable cause. probable cause reason based upon known facts to believe a crime has been committed or that certain property relates to a crime.</p>

    <p>As an RTP officer, you will specialise in all forms of pursuits, roadblocks, and tactical manoeuvres.</p><br><p>A pursuit is a day-to-day encounter all officers will find, as an RTP unit, your responsibility is to take action in pursuits; RTP officers have authority to take a primary position in a pursuit as well as to take over Communications, this is unless an Interceptor Unit is available or if it is an armed call. As a PCSO and Response officer, you should have encountered a few pursuits and be familiar with what they are and how they work.</p><br><p>Tactical Maneuvers are used by RTP trained officers when a pursuit is deemed dangerous for the public and needs to be stopped (usually when the pursuit goes for more than 7 minutes). Different Tactical Maneuvers RTP officers use and also what you would learn to do in the training is a pit, and a hard stop / TPAC.</p><br>A pit is where an officer would nudge a fleeing vehicle by hitting the rear wheel of a moving vehicle. Pits can only be performed below 100MPH (miles per hour) and they are performed with intent to spin out a fleeing suspect's vehicle.<br>
    <img  class="policetrainingimage" src="img/policetraning2.png">
    <br>
    <img class="policetrainingimage" src="img/policetraning3.png" >
    <p>A Hard Stop is a maneuver which RTP and SCO-19 officers would perform with intent to slow down and stop a moving vehicle safely without disturbing the civilians as much as you would continuing a high speed pursuit. This is performed by several officers surrounding each side of the vehicle and gradually lowering their speed to slow down the vehicle. A TPAC is a maneuver which involves 2 or more officers to box in a stationary or slow-moving vehicle, this is performed by one officer taking front and back of the vehicle to box it in and stop it from fleeing; more officers can lead to it being more successful. Roadblocks are a Traffic officers specialty; a roadblock is where you would create a diversion or road closure using a series of cones and barriers. Roadblocks are mainly used when an RTC (Road Traffic Collision) occurs; this is a way to protect the RTC from incoming traffic and to make the RTC site more safer while diverting traffic instead of closing the entire road off. In your training, you will have to create a few roadblocks, some diagrams of roadblocks we use can be found below. </p>
    <h3><u>View Diagrams under for Roadblock images</u></h3>
    <img src="img/policetraning4.png" alt="">
    <img src="img/policetraning5.png" alt="">
    <h3><u>How the training works</u></h3>
    <p>The RTP course contains several sections which are brought up during training which you will need to learn and perform. This includes a Driving Test, Tactical Maneuver Test, Pursuit Test, Roadblock Test, and  
        a Communications Test. A few Tactical Maneuvers were explained above and are accompanied with diagrams of how they should look when executed; this is also the same for Roadblocks. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Driving Test is a way which the trainer would assess your driving in the worst road conditions, the trainer should give you a speed to not go over during the Test and a few guidelines / conditions that will need to be followed if you aim to score high marks during your RTP training. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Communication is a vital part of the training which you will need to revise and learn; all officers rely on good communications. In the training, the trainer will explain how the communications should be relayed and what to mention during communicating. The main parts of comms we look for during the training is: Locations (Road Names, Postal Codes), Direction (North,East,South,West), DRA Level (Danger Risk Assessment), and the Description of the suspect or vehicle (Person: Racial Code, Clothing) (Car: Colour, License Plate, Make and Model, Doors).
        </p>
    <h3><u>Road Traffic Act Laws and Sections</u></h3>
    <p>In the training, you will need to know and understand at least 8 common known sections which relate to Roads and Transport Policing. Below this you will find 8 common sections which you will need to learn and revise before attempting the Traffic Test.</p>
    <li>Section 1 - Death By Dangerous Driving</li>
    <li>Section 2 - Dangerous Driving</li>
    <li>Section 4 - Driving Under The Influence</li>
    <li>Section 28 - Dangerous Cycling</li>
    <li>Section 89 - Exceeding Any Legal Speed Limit</li>
    <li>Section 163 Sub Section 1 - Failure to Stop for Police</li>
    <li>Section 164 - Gives power to acquire a Driving License or ID on a Traffic Stop</li>
    <li>Section 165 = Authority to Sieze a Vehicle</li>
    <hr>
    <p><strong><i>This is a rough idea of what to expect during the RTP Training and also what you will need to know or learn. From the Heads of the RTP Division, we wish you good luck during your training and hope to see you in RTP soon!</i></strong></p>
